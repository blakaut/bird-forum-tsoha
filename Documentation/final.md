# How did it go

Even though the project progressed well until the third submission, the last submission proved to be more difficult than I hoped it to be. I had limited time to work with the project and my Visual Studio Code started causing serious freezes in my system, which made working harder -- just when this kind of a thing wasn't welcome.

Anyway, the major addition I did in the last submission cycle was a search function for the content of the site, even though it doesn't work as well as I'd hoped it would. The code is hopefully a bit easier to read now and there should be less clutter in the SQL inquiries, making the performance a bit better.

What was left on the table was a moderator account. It would have been neat to have an account with extra features. The private messaging system could also have been made richer.

## Added after the midnight deadline

I forgot to mention that the registration system was also fixed for the final submission. It really didn't have many failsafes. For the midnight update the registration system was broken due to a bug, which I fixed after midnight.
