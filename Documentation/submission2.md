# 2nd Submission

## What works now

There is a front page that offers links for all available categories. There are also links for logging in or registering an account.

You can register an account by providing a username and password combination. The registration process logs you in automatically, but you can log out and in freely by using provided links.

As an unregistered user you can see all the discussion on the forum, but you'll need an account to start new threads or add replies to existing threads.

The application is available to try in Heroku. It should work somewhat intuitively.

## What doesn't work or isn't yet included

There are no tiers for registered users (for example 'administrator' or 'moderator'), nor are there any categories or threads that would be hidden to some users. There is also no option to remove or modify a post or thread.

There are no profile pages or ways to search for users, threads or replies.

The login/registration pages are a bit clunky. Some pages' redirects are also not the best for user experience.
