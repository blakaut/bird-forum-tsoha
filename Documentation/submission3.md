# 3nd Submission

## What works now

The previous submission had bugs regarding many fields accepting empty inputs, including registration and login form fields. There were also vulnerabilities for SQL injections. To what checking I was able to do, these have been fixed now.

There is now a system for private messaging. It is quite simple, somewhat clunky and looks ancient.

A profile page was implemented. The page works differently depending on if it is the current user's profile page or an another user's page. The page includes personal info: a bio and private messages.

The site also looks much more pleasant now and is mostly somewhat intuitive. The most notable improvement is navigation through top and side bars, that are rendered onto the page through their own routing.

## What doesn't work or isn't yet included

The most essential purely technical issues are a search function for messages and/or threads and a system for moderator accounts.

If I manage, I'd like to also have some sort of a "like" system for replies in the forum discussion. Profile pictures could also be nice.

On the UI side I'd like to improve the category UI.
